# Requirements
## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
Deep learning frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, 
GPU support: LSTMs and CLSTMs are computationally intensive and can benefit from GPU acceleration. Therefore, the software must have support for GPUs, either through the deep learning framework or the hardware.
Data pre-processing tools: NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, 
Evaluation metrics: Scikit-learn
Development environment: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

## HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
Processor: GPU or a specialized hardware accelerator such as a TPU.
Memory: The amount of memory required depends on the size of the model, the batch size used during training, and the size of the input data.
Storage: The size of the input data and the model parameters can be large, so sufficient storage is required to store these data. Additionally, it is important to have a backup and version control system for the data and models.
Network: A high-speed network connection is required to communicate between the machines.

## LANGUAGE SPECIFICATION
Python Version: Deep learning frameworks and libraries support Python versions 3.5
Keras: Version 3.5 – 3.8
Tensorflow: Version 3.5 – 3.9
